- **Root Node**
    - The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node.
- **Leaf Node**
    - The nodes which do not have any child nodes.
- **Parent Node**
    - The node which is a predecessor of a node.
- **Child Node**
    - The node which is the immediate successor of a node.
- **Ancestor**
    - Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node.
- **Descendant**
    - Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node.
- **Subtree**
    - Any node of the tree along with its descendant.
