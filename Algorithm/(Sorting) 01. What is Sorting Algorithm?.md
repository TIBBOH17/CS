# Sorting Algorithm
- An algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.
- Rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.

# Stability
- **Stable Sort**
  - Maintains the relative order of the items with equal sort keys.
  - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Unstable Sort**
  - Which is not stable.
  - Selection Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
 
# In-Place
- **In-Place Algorithm**
  - Sorts the input array in place, without using any additional memory. (Strict Definition)
  - Does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though non-constant extra space for its operation. (Broad Definition)
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort (by Broad Definition), etc.
- **Not In-Place Algorithm**
  - Which is not in-place
  - Merge Sort, etc.
